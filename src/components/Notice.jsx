                            We realized these are tough times, and we have held our prices for as long as we can.
                            However, cost factors such as water and electric bills have been increasing multiple times
                            these past few months. With these factors in mind, we will be implementing additional charge of
                            <span className='fw-bold'> â‚±250.00 for the use of SAUNA</span> with the inclusions of:
                        </Typography>
                    </Col>
                    <Col xs={12} className='d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center'>
                        {inclusionItems}

                        <Typography className='p-3 text-center'>
                            Although every effort is being made to manage our costs, we hope you understand that factors beyond
                            our control have made this increase inevitable.
                            We aspire to your continued support and loyalty to <span className='fw-bold'>North Haven Spa </span>
                            and vow to continue providing excellent servies for you.
